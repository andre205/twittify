# Project Twittify

## Team Member: Nick Erbach

### Contributions this far:
* For our first submission I assisted Tyler in getting the Spotify API set up, which ended up being a success. 
* My other main contribution this week was creating and submitting our abstract for our group.

### Next Goals:
 * My next goal is working with Tyler to link the Spotify and Twitter APIs together so we can begin using their 
individual features together.
