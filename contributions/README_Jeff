Twittify Project

Team Member: Jeff Haskell

Work done:
          1) Researched a possible GUI language (React_Native)
            i) Ended up being too cumbersome for project

          2) Researched twitter4j for integration with app
            i) Works well for our project
           ii) Added as a dependency for our project

          3) Helped design application structure to be integrated with GUI

Goals:
          1) Completely integrate the Twitter class with the spotify class
          2) Implement the two classes into a single class and use with GUI
